# Streaming File Upload Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the refactored file upload mechanism that replaces the previous client-side chunking approach with a continuous streaming upload system. The new implementation is designed to address performance issues and improve upload speed consistency while maintaining strict compliance with Notion API specifications.

## Performance Issues Addressed

### Previous Implementation Problems

1. **Client-Side Chunking Delays**: The old system created 5MB chunks on the client and introduced artificial delays (300-1000ms) between uploads, causing downward spikes in upload speed.

2. **Server-Side Memory Overhead**: Each 5MB chunk was cached in memory on the server before processing, leading to high memory usage and potential memory pressure.

3. **Worker Thread Overhead**: Each chunk spawned a new thread, creating unnecessary overhead and resource contention.

4. **WebSocket Protocol Overhead**: Using WebSocket for binary data transfer added framing overhead and complexity.

5. **Synchronization Complexity**: Managing chunk ordering and retry logic was complex and error-prone.

## New Streaming Architecture

### Client-Side Changes

The new client-side implementation (`static/streaming-upload.js`) eliminates chunking entirely:

```javascript
// Old approach: Create 5MB chunks with delays
const chunkSize = 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5MB chunks
const delayBetweenChunks = isLargeFile ? 1000 : 300; // Artificial delays

// New approach: Continuous streaming
const fileStream = this.createFileStream(file, progressCallback);
fetch('/api/upload/stream/upload-id', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: fileStream, // Stream directly without chunking
    duplex: 'half'    // Enable streaming without buffering
});
```

#### Key Improvements:

1. **ReadableStream Implementation**: Files are streamed using native browser ReadableStream API
2. **Small Read Buffers**: Uses 64KB read chunks instead of 5MB, reducing memory footprint
3. **No Artificial Delays**: Continuous data flow without interruptions
4. **Direct HTTP Streaming**: Eliminates WebSocket overhead

### Server-Side Changes

The new server-side implementation (`uploader/streaming_uploader.py`) provides intelligent buffering:

```python
# Automatic single-part vs multipart decision
SINGLE_PART_THRESHOLD = 20 * 1024 * 1024  # 20 MiB
MULTIPART_CHUNK_SIZE = 5 * 1024 * 1024    # 5 MiB for multipart

def process_stream(self, upload_session, stream_generator):
    if upload_session['is_multipart']:
        return self._process_multipart_stream(upload_session, stream_generator)
    else:
        return self._process_single_part_stream(upload_session, stream_generator)
```

#### Key Improvements:

1. **Intelligent Buffering**: Server buffers data only as needed, respecting Notion API limits
2. **Single Thread Processing**: One stream processor per upload, eliminating thread creation overhead
3. **Memory Efficient**: Processes data in small chunks without caching entire file parts
4. **Automatic API Compliance**: Handles single-part (≤20MB) and multipart (>20MB) uploads automatically

## API Endpoints

### 1. Create Upload Session
```
POST /api/upload/create-session
```
Creates a new upload session and determines upload strategy based on file size.

### 2. Stream File Upload
```
POST /api/upload/stream/{upload_id}
```
Handles the actual file streaming with continuous data processing.

### 3. Upload Status
```
GET /api/upload/status/{upload_id}
```
Returns current upload progress and status.

### 4. Abort Upload
```
POST /api/upload/abort/{upload_id}
```
Cancels an active upload and cleans up resources.

## Notion API Compliance

The implementation strictly adheres to Notion API specifications:

### Single-Part Upload (≤ 20 MiB)
- Files up to 20 MiB are uploaded in a single request
- Efficient for small to medium files
- Minimal API overhead

### Multi-Part Upload (> 20 MiB)
- Files larger than 20 MiB use multipart upload
- Each part is exactly 5 MiB (except the final part)
- Proper multipart upload lifecycle:
  1. Initiation with Notion API
  2. Upload parts with presigned URLs
  3. Completion or abortion as needed

## Performance Improvements

### Upload Speed Consistency
- **Before**: Sawtooth pattern with spikes and drops due to chunking delays
- **After**: Smooth, consistent upload speed maintained throughout

### Memory Usage Reduction
- **Before**: Up to 5MB × number of concurrent uploads cached in memory
- **After**: Small streaming buffers (64KB) with immediate processing

### CPU Overhead Reduction
- **Before**: Thread creation/destruction for each 5MB chunk
- **After**: Single stream processor per upload

### Network Efficiency
- **Before**: WebSocket framing overhead + artificial delays
- **After**: Direct HTTP streaming with optimal throughput

## Error Handling and Reliability

### Improved Error Detection
- **Immediate Error Reporting**: Stream processing detects errors immediately
- **Proper Cleanup**: Failed uploads are cleaned up automatically
- **Retry Capability**: Built-in retry mechanisms without re-uploading completed portions

### Resource Management
- **Session Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of old upload sessions
- **Memory Management**: No accumulation of cached chunks
- **Connection Management**: Proper handling of connection errors and timeouts

## Migration Guide

### For Developers

1. **Client-Side**: Replace `uploadFile()` function calls with the new streaming implementation
2. **Server-Side**: Use new streaming endpoints instead of legacy chunk upload routes
3. **Configuration**: No configuration changes needed - automatic API compliance

### Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains backward compatibility by:
- Keeping existing UI elements and progress reporting
- Maintaining the same success/error callback structure
- Preserving file list refresh functionality

## Testing

To test the new streaming upload:

1. **Small Files (< 20MB)**: Should use single-part upload automatically
2. **Large Files (> 20MB)**: Should use multipart upload with 5MB chunks
3. **Progress Reporting**: Should show smooth, consistent progress
4. **Error Handling**: Should properly handle network interruptions
5. **Memory Usage**: Should maintain low memory footprint during uploads

## Future Enhancements

1. **Resume Capability**: Implement upload resume for interrupted large files
2. **Parallel Uploads**: Support multiple concurrent file uploads
3. **Compression**: Add optional compression for certain file types
4. **Bandwidth Throttling**: Implement configurable upload speed limits

## Conclusion

The new streaming upload implementation eliminates the performance bottlenecks of the previous chunking approach while maintaining full Notion API compliance. The result is faster, more reliable file uploads with lower resource usage and better user experience.
