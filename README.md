# Notion Storage

## Features

- Upload single files or entire folders through the web interface. Large files are
  streamed and split into multipart uploads automatically.
- Create, rename, delete, and move files or folders to organize content in a
  hierarchical structure.
- Share files with publicly accessible links that can be protected with a
  password and optional expiration time.

of defaults and inline docs. Key settings:
